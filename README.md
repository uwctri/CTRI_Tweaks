# CTRI Tweaks - Redcap External Module

## What is this?

CTRI Tweaks is a collection of small tweaks that are too minor or specific to CTRI to justify a published EM. When a feature or group of features is sufficently mature we spin that off into its own EM.

## Installing

This module isn't available via the REDCap EM repo, you'll need to drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/ctri_tweaks_v1.0.0`).
