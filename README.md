# CTRI Tweaks - Redcap External Module

## What is this?

CTRI Tweaks is a collection of small tweaks that are too minor to warrent their own EM. When a feature or group of features is sufficently developed they are spun off into their own EM. This code base doesn't undergo regular code review and is quite messy. In general the EM Class parses settings an then loads one of many JS files. Several custom action tags exist that you may wish to review and copy.
